==== STRIDE ANALYSIS ====
Stride distribution:
  Small strides (<=64 bytes): 84693 (51.14%)
  Medium strides (65-512 bytes): 12081 (7.29%)
  Large strides (>512 bytes): 68837 (41.57%)

Most common specific strides:
       8 bytes:      34113 occurrences (20.60%)
       0 bytes:       7885 occurrences (4.76%)
      16 bytes:       5922 occurrences (3.58%)
      32 bytes:       5707 occurrences (3.45%)
       4 bytes:       4638 occurrences (2.80%)
      40 bytes:       3187 occurrences (1.92%)
      28 bytes:       3136 occurrences (1.89%)
      12 bytes:       3065 occurrences (1.85%)
      24 bytes:       3033 occurrences (1.83%)
       1 bytes:       2634 occurrences (1.59%)

Cache-friendliness assessment:
  MODERATE: Mixed stride patterns detected, somewhat cache-friendly.
